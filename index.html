      <p class="story"> This is my very first experience escaping death with a slight margin. It happened when I was in Vietnam. At that moment, there was a storm all over the middle part of Vietnam. I and my parents did not expect this and arrived a couple of days before the storm even start to visit our grandparents. The storm slowly got stronger to the point that we had the warning to stay inside and close all the doors carefully. So one day, I and my father felt like the wind was getting weaker so we took a stroll for fresh air. On the way back, right before we were entering the house, the extremely huge tree in front of the yard fell right behind us, literally behind. It was kind of scary because imagine what would happen if we got back only a couple of seconds later. </p>


      <p class="story"> Almost 2 years later, I would not expect to experience such another terrifying event. My family was on vacation and if I am not mistaken, it was in the summer. We stayed at a hotel where there was a huge swimming pool near the lobby. So one late night, my family decided to go for a swim. It was pretty cold outside so it felt super nice to have a heated swimming pool. Little did I know that it would let me to drowning. My relatives and parents were still getting ready and they did not notice I was heading to the pool. I was careful about that age, I slowly stood on each stair leading down to the water. The comfortable feeling of warm water let me step on an extra step down the pool. I did not expect that one step completely put me off the ground and straight to the water. It was every terrifying, the feeling of unable to scream while you are panicking and trying to do everything to stay alive. After a while me body movement became weaker and weaker. It took a while for someone to notice that I was drowning. The next thing I remember was waking up in the bed in my room. I must have blacked out. I also remembered coughing out a lot of water. I did not know how to swim at the time and was scared to get into the water for a few years later. However, I have overcome my fear now and learned how to swim well.</p>

      <p class="story"> My last near-death experience happened 4 years later after the drowning incident. Once again, it happened during my vacation to the middle part of Vietnam. One day, I was visiting my favorite cousins to hang out with them. Two of my cousins mentioned were grown-ups and older than me. The other two were quite younger. I still remembered we had a super full meal for lunch to the point that I felt so sleepy and ready to pass out. While I was lying down, one of my younger cousins stupidly decided to jump on my stomach. It was painful for a while and I was mad, but the pain slowly subdues after. The first night was fine, nothing happened much. However, the day later, when we were going out for a family dinner in a restaurant, I suddenly felt uneasy in the stomach. At first, I thought I just had a stomachache or needed to go to the bathroom. We had a cousin as a doctor there to and he said it was fine. The pain started to increase as I have to lay down on one of the chairs in the restaurant. That night, it became so painful and I got a fever too so I had to take a lot of medicine. The day after that, my mom got so scared that she took me to the hospital to get me a scan. I was horrified when the doctor said something and told me I really need surgery. On my way back to the car, I even bumped my head very hard when trying to get in the car, but it was only the cherry on the cake. I do not remember much in between but I remember my mom and my doctor cousin taking me to the hospital to prepare for surgery. I even had to go around the hospital in a wheelchair. Man, the feeling of saying goodbye to your family as you go in the surgery room was quite scary for a 14 years old kid. The next thing I remembered was waking up on the hospital bed. It felt so tight around my waist that I thought I was wearing a super tight jean. For some reason, my family was not around at the time, so I turned into the next bed patient's relative and asked them for a favor. I asked them to please loosen my pants for me. The thing is, <b>I WAS NOT WEARING ANY PANTS</b>. Oh wow, that was sooo embarrassing. She even laughed at me. It is like I forgot the feeling of how to walk after that. I was not able to walk around for a few days. I was only injected with the IV and could not eat. There was a point where my cousin even faked taking a picture of my naked bottom and showed to everyone. I was very mad and cried. He felt bad afterward. In the end, I got dispatched out of the hospital and felt like it quite an experience, not too bad though. However, the doctor said that if we had waited any longer for the surgery, it would have become critical and a whole other problem. My appendix could have burste and I could have died. But oh well, I am glad it did not happen.</p>
